## Our Data

A famous saying in data science that stresses the importance of valuable data goes as follows: “Garbage in, garbage
out”. In our case, it implies that if we want to extract valuable insights then we must enrich and preprocess our data.
Initially, we wanted to use the CMU Movie Corpus dataset; however, we discovered that many of its ratings and box office
revenues were missing. Instead of removing these movies, we decided to enrich our data with scraped data. Of course,
there is no better website than IMDb to get the information that we want, so we did just that. You should also know that
we used a few other datasets, notably of yearly inflation, but those will be mentioned later.
In summary, we went out of our way to have as much valuable data as possible so that you may trust our findings.
