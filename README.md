### Abstract:

The Formula for a Perfect Movie is a project that aims to uncover the complexity of cinematic success by examining
diverse features, including ratings, revenue, genre, inclusivity, and more. Motivated by the nuanced nature of film
achievement, we introduce a new Movie Score metric that considers ratings and revenue, providing a robust measure of a
movie's success. We aim to offer valuable insights into the secrets of successful filmmaking. By considering diverse and
valuable data sources, this project seeks to explore the value that can be extracted thanks to Data Science.

In our data story, we guide our readers through the investigative processes that were utilized on our journey to detect
the key influencers of good movies. As we unravel the insights embedded in the data, we hope that the reader will be
encouraged towards introspection, thinking about what they believe makes a successful movie.

# Research questions

In this project, we aim to tackle the following research questions:

* How can we define the success of a movie?
* Can we consider ratings and movie revenue to determine a success metric? Is there a correlation between ratings and
  movie revenue?
* Is there a formula that successful movies follow?
* Which features influence the success of a movie?
    * Considering: movie duration, language, geographical location of the setting, budget, genre, ethnic inclusivity,
      fame of actors, fame of producers, movie plot sentiment analysis, and movie sequels.
